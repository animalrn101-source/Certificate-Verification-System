# 🎓 Certificate Verification System (Blockchain-Based)

## 🧩 Overview
The **Certificate Verification System** is a decentralized application (DApp) built on blockchain technology to issue, verify, and manage digital certificates securely.  
It ensures that educational institutions, organizations, and employers can **authenticate certificates** without intermediaries — making forgery nearly impossible.
